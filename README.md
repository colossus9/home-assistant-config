# Home Assistant Configuration

I have long wanted a dashboard at home to help manage automation around the house. [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) checks off many of the requirements I needed, including 
integrations with popular components, a way to display a top-level dashboard from a distance, and customizable home automation "readiness" for various home/audio/video devices. This is my active 
Home Assistant configuration.
